CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/peter/ros2.1/UsbCaptureROS4/build/common/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/peter/ros2/UsbCaptureROS4/build/common where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
